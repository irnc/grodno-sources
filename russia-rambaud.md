> "He began," says a chronicle, "by slaying his brothers and his sons, chased the survivors from the country, and reigned alone over the land of Lithuania." Thence he led his savage warriors against the Russian principalities, now enfeebled by the Mongol invasions, and conquered Grodno and Novogrodek. Happily Western Russia had two great men at its head, Alexander Nevski and Daniel of Volhynia. Threatened on one side by these princes, on the other by the knights of Livonia, the Lithuanians bethought themselves of hastening to the Pope and embracing the Catholic faith. A legate of In- nocent IV. and the landmeister of the Teutonic Order came to Grodno, escorted by a brilliant suite of cavaliers. In presence of an immense concourse of people, Mindvog received baptism with his wife, and was consecrated King of Lithuania (1252).

> She recovered herself under the enterprising and energetic Gedimin (1315-1340), the real founder of her power. He turned the exhaustion and divisions of South Russia to his own profit; and to the conquests of his predecessors—Grodno, Pinsk, Brest, and Polotsk—soon added Tchernigof, and all Volhynia with Vladimir, under whose walls he defeated the Russians, aided though they were by an auxiliary army of Tatars

> In May 1654 the Tzar Alexis solemnly announced in the Ouspienski Sobor that he had resolved to march in person against his enemy the King of Poland. He commanded that in this campaign no occasion should be given for the generals to dispute precedence. The Polish voievodes affirm that on this occasion "Moscow made war in quite a new way, and conquered the people by the clemency and gentleness of the Tzar." This humanity, so well timed in a war of deliverance, contributed greatly to the success of the Muscovites. Polotsk, Mohilef, and all the towns of White Russia opened their gates one after the other, and Smolensk only resisted five weeks (1654). The following year the Prince Tcherkasski defeated the hetman Radziwill and began the conquest of Lithuania proper: Wilna, the capital, Grodno, and Kobno, fell successively.

> A diet was convoked at Grodno, under the pressure of the Russian bayonets. This same pressure, en- forced by pecuniary corruption, had been exercised in the elections, and the King was in some sense dragged to Grodno to preside over the ruin of his country.
> -- p. 120

> Souvorof refused to treat with Potocki and the men of the 17th April, and King Stanislas had to act as mediator. Souvorof guaranteed to the inhabitants their property, a pardon, and passports to all compromised per- sons. He made his entrance into Warsaw, and was created Field-marshal by the Empress. The King was sent to Grodno. The third treaty of partition, forced on the Empress by the importunity of Prussia, and in which Austria also took part, was put in execution. Russia took the rest of Lithuania as far as the Niemen (Wilna, Grodno, Kovno, Novogrodek, Slonim,) and the rest of Volhynia to the Bug (Vladimir, Loutsk, and Kremenetz).

> He withdrew his forces from Persia, and left Georgia to
its own levies. To the Poles he even showed some pity, re- called prisoners from Siberia, transferred King Stanislas from
Grodno to St. Petersburg, visited Kosciuszko at Schliisselburg,
and set him, with the other captives, at liberty.

Oudinot, Ney, the Guard commanded by Bessieres, the immense
reserve cavalry under Murat—in all a total of 180,000 men ; before Pilony, Eugene with 50,000 Italians and Bavarians ; before
Grodno, Jerome Bonaparte, with 60,000 Poles, Westphalians,
