> Vilna, (that great and goodly metropolis) Grodno, and many other towns of Littaw, are horridly defaced, ruinated, or quite laid into ashes. A number of dead corps lying every where unburied, none is able to travell or abide the stench thereof. The whole land is in a manner dispeopled, and nothing but a hideous howling of dogs and other beasts are heard therein. The great duke of Muscovy hath promised to send shortly ambassadors to his electoral highness, having bestowed a rich present upon the foresaid secretary. In a word, all Lithuania, an excellent country, and abounding with all necessaries, is utterly wasted and undone.
